# The HomeLab Blueprint: Infrastructure as Research

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mwithiga Labs | Security Wing**
> This repository serves as a step-by-step masterplan for building a secure, isolated virtual research environment.

Hey there, fellow seeker! I'm **Mwithiga**.

I've always been a tinkerer, driven by a curiosity to understand how the digital world works from the ground up. In Cybersecurity, understanding the infrastructure is just as critical as understanding the exploit. This guide is my documented journey into the world of self-hosting and private server architecture.

## 🛡️ Why Build a HomeLab?

A HomeLab isn't just a server; it's a **Portal** into advanced system administration and security research. 
- **Isolated Research**: Test tools like **ThreatScope** and **Portal** in a safe, controlled sandbox.
- **Root-Level Mastery**: Gain experience with hypervisors, networking zones, and server hardening.
- **Disaster Readiness**: Learn to rebuild from zero with structured, clear documentation.

## 🗺️ The Seeker's Roadmap

This blueprint is divided into specialized chapters for rapid deployment:
1. **[Chapter 1: The Proxmox Foundation](chapters/chapter1-proxmox-foundation.md)** - Setting up the hypervisor base.
2. **[Chapter 2: The pfSense Perimeter](chapters/chapter2-pfsense-perimeter.md)** - Building the virtual gatekeeper.
3. **[Chapter 3: Ubuntu Server Core](chapters/chapter3-ubuntu-server-core.md)** - Hardening the workhorse.

## 🏁 Operational Status

> [!TIP]
> **Current Status**: All core chapters are live. The lab is ready for infiltration.

## 📖 The Development Journey

The path to a working homelab was filled with learning experiences. 

### The Networking Wall
My biggest hurdle was understanding the paradox of choice in virtualization and the "Networking Nightmare" of VLANs. I spent weeks deciphering virtual bridges and firewall rules until I realized that networking is just another story to be told through configuration.

### The Recovery Blueprint
The real motivation for this project came after a power outage corrupted a critical disk. I realized my scattered notes were useless under pressure. I committed to this structured guide not just for others, but as a **Disaster Recovery Plan** for my own lab. 

By documentation each step as a self-contained chapter, I transformed a messy setup into a clear, repeatable architecture.
