# My Homelab Setup Guide

Hey there, fellow seeker! I'm Mwithiga.

I've always been a tinkerer, driven by a curiosity to understand how the digital world works from the ground up. This curiosity led me down the rabbit hole of self-hosting and building my own homelab. It started with a simple question: "What does it take to build my own private cloud and server infrastructure?"

This repository is the answer to that question. It's my personal, living document detailing the steps, challenges, and configurations I've used to build and maintain my own homelab. I created it to organize my own notes and to share my journey with other enthusiasts who are starting out.

## The Guides

This project is a collection of step-by-step guides for setting up various components of a homelab.

- **Virtualization:** [Proxmox Setup Guide](./Proxmox_Setup.md)
- **Networking:** [Router Setup Guide](./Router_Setup.md)
- _... (and more to come)_

## The Development Journey

The biggest challenge with a project like this isn't a single bug, but the sheer amount of trial and error. Setting up a homelab involves navigating dozens of different technologies, from hardware choices and BIOS settings to networking, virtualization, and containerization.

I often found myself solving a problem, only to forget the exact steps a few months later when I needed to rebuild or reconfigure something. That's why I decided to create this guide. My primary goal was to fight against that "knowledge decay" by documenting every important step in a clear, easy-to-follow format.

Writing these guides forced me to truly understand each part of the process, not just copy-paste commands. It transformed my scattered notes into a structured library of my own knowledge. My hope is that by sharing my process, I can save other homelab beginners some time and help them on their own journey of discovery.
